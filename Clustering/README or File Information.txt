I am learning the application of K Means Clustering here, Notebook may or may not be correct steps to derive a solution

Analyze product spending, and split them into how they purchase:

cust_seg_product_clustering: 3 clusters

cust_seg_product_more_clustering: 5 clusters



Insight(s) from cust_seg_product_clustering:

Groupings could be due to income


Insight(s) from cust_seg_product_more_clustering:

A group spend above average on wines and meat

A group that spend highly on gold
