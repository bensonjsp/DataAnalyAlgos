I am learning the application of K Means Clustering here, Notebook may or may not be correct steps to derive a solution


Income defined as such:

Low: <= $50,000

Medium: > $50,000 and <= $150,000

High: > $150,000 (8 data points, not analyzed)



Files:

Low Income)

cust_seg_product_low_income_clustering: 3 clusters

cust_seg_product_low_income_more_clustering: 5 clusters

Medium Income)

cust_seg_product_med_income_clustering: 3 clusters

cust_seg_product_med_income_more_clustering: 5 clusters
